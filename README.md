# NFT Marketplace Project

This project implements an NFT marketplace using the ERC-721 standard, enabling minting, buying, and selling of NFTs on a decentralized platform.

The frontend is built using React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and Next.js, providing a modern and responsive user interface. The backend is developed using Hardhat, Solidity, and TypeScript, enabling secure smart contract deployment, interaction, and testing.

## Overview

This backend allows users to mint, buy, sell, and transfer NFTs on Ethereum-based networks (e.g., Sepolia or Mainnet). It includes the deployment and management of ERC-721 smart contracts, providing the foundation for a decentralized NFT marketplace.

Key features include:

- Minting NFTs: Creating new NFTs based on the ERC-721 standard.
- Buying & Selling: Interacting with the marketplace to facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs.
- Smart Contract Testing: Ensuring contract functionality with automated test scripts.

The backend is responsible for the smart contract development, deployment, and interaction, while the frontend allows users to interact with the marketplace through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- frontend/ - Contains the frontend code, including React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and Next.js for the user interface.
- backend/ - Contains the backend code for smart contract development, testing, and deployment using Hardhat, Solidity, and TypeScript.
